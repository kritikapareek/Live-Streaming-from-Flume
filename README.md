# Live-Streaming-from-Flume
This repository contains the academic project of BigData Streaming from Twitter through Apache Flume.


The data that is to be processed using Apache Hadoop is required to be stored
in HDFS. The main challenge in handling the log data is moving these logs produced by
multiple servers to the Hadoop environment following the continuous data stream and
different formats of data. Flume helps the purpose and at a much faster rate.

We are fetching the data from Twitter through API.
